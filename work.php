        <h3 class="head">Jahangir Puri, Delhi</h3>
            <p>Jahangir Puri is part of the 44 JJR colonies developed by DDA under the Plan
                    Scheme of JJ Resettlement during the period 1960 â€“ 85. Located in north-west
                    Delhi, it is Ward No. 21 in the Delhi Metropolitan Area and is a large slum cluster
                    which is divided into 12 blocks. The area comprises of migrants mostly from the
                    eastern states such as West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The migrants are
                    mostly Bengali Muslims. As per provisional reports of Census India, population of
                    Bhalswa Jahangir Pur in 2011 is 1,97,148; of which male and female are 1,06,388
                    and 90,760 respectively. 76.5 % are Hindus while Muslims comprise 21.5% of the
                    population. The remaining 2% comprise of other religions like Sikh, Christian, Jain,
                    Buddhist, etc. A larger section of population belongs to dalit community in the area.
                    The average literacy rate is 77.6%, where the average literacy rate of men is 84.21%
                    that of women is about 70%. There are more than 5000 households in the area and
                    most are engaged in the trade of rag-picking and daily wage earners.
                    As the population of the area mainly comprises of migrants, no uniform language is
                    spoken as they speak in their regional dialect. Since the migrants belong to the
                    states of West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the language most commonly
                    spoken here are Magahi, Hindi and Bangla. All the houses in the area are pakka
                    houses which are constructed in a cramped manner leaving no space between the
                    adjoining houses and leaving narrow streets. Although the locality has a community
                    centre but it lacks community recreation centres and library. Public Distribution
                    System (PDS) is available and functions systematically in each block. While the
                    electricity here is provided by the New Delhi Power Ltd. (NDPL), the residents have
                    access to water supplied by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB). The locality also has a DJB
                    office. The residents have access to medical services at Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital
                    apart from the various private clinics available in the locality. Moreover, every block
                    has a dispensary each.
                    The people here are not very educated and they are mostly labourers, rag-pickers or
                    vegetable/fruits hawkers. But the presence of government schools and by the help
                    and initiative of the organisations working in the locality has encouraged the parents
                    and children alike, and many children have taken up education with prospects of a
                    better future. At present, there are 3 government schools upto senior secondary
                    level, while every block has a primary level government school or Nagar Nigam
                    Prathamik Vidyalaya. For higher studies children opt for colleges in Delhi University
                    or IGNOU. This eagerness for education has helped some families and their children
                    who now are educated/ skilled enough to secure a respectable job and support their
                    families. This has also led to many youth from the community itself to take up the
                    initiative of helping the other families in the community.
                    The issues prevailing in the colony are unemployment, poverty, illiteracy, poor health
                    and sanitation, domestic violence, child labour, female foeticide, alcoholism, drug
                    abuse etc.</p>
