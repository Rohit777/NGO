            <p>
            To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we may use "cookies", or similar electronic
            tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification
            (User ID) to understand the user's individual interests using the Identified Computer. Unless you
            voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of knowing who
            you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can
            contain is information you supply (an example of this is when you ask for our Personalised
            Horoscope). A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their
            own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we do not control. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the
            Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets
            computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.)
            Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages
            to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users, to measure traffic within our site
            and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where our visitors come.

            <h4 id="links"><strong>LINKS TO THE OTHER SITES</strong></h4>
            <p>The Site contains links to other websites for the benefit of its visitors. This Privacy Policy does not
            apply to such other websites. CRY is not expressly or impliedly responsible for, or liable to any loss or
            damage caused to you by the collection, use and retention of Personal Information by such website
            in any manner whatsoever. It is important that you review the privacy policies of all websites you

            <h4 id="information"><strong>INFORMATION SECURITY</strong></h4>
            <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized
                alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, 
                storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and
                physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store
                personal data.</p>
            <p>All information gathered on our Website is securely stored within our controlled database. The
                database is stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected
                and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is
                impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that
                information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And,
                of course, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone
                with Internet access. </p>
            <p>However the internet is an ever evolving medium. We may change our Privacy Policy from time to
                time to incorporate necessary future changes. Of course, our use of any information we gather will
                always be consistent with the policy under which the information was collected, regardless of what
                the new policy may be. </p>
