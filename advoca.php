        The core of advocacy is the understanding of the capacity to make changes in the policies
        and its practice, which caters to change on a larger scale. Advocacy thus helps bridge the
        gap between the agency and the beneficiary. It provides the agencies with the opportunity
        and the platform to convey their message, through means of campaigning, to the
        communities and increase awareness about their rights and provisions.</br>
        Through advocacy the marginalized communities and the society at large can be made
        aware, responsible and can be made capable towards the problems existing in the society,
        especially which are relevant to them, like gender and caste based discrimination, prevalent
        social, educational and economic inequalities and many such issues.</br>
        We engage both at the community and policy level for advocacy and campaigning. Working
        at the community level exposes us to the challenges and obstacles faced by the girls and
        women from the marginalized communities and our engagement at the policy level helps
        incorporate solutions and opportunities relevant to the marginalized communities. This
        approach helps make a larger impact on the society by creating aware and informed
        citizens.
