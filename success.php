          Although she had to discontinue her studies due to poor financial condition, she 
          always had a dream of completing her education and achieving something in life. In 
          2013 she got involved with Kanshiram Welfare Foundation and enrolled in the Adobe Youth

          studies from where she had left. Since she wanted to study and obtain a Bachelor degree 
          but didnâ€™t want to pursue her school studies, she enrolled in IGNOU for the certificate 
          course of Bachelor Preparatory Program after completion of which she could enroll for the 
          Bachelor degree program. She acquired a job in the retail sector after completing her graduation.
