    Kanshiram Welfare Foundation is a research and action based non-profit organization established in
    2008. It aims to extend the opportunities for marginalized section across various social groups within
    the society. It primarily works in the areas of Education, Livelihood and Advocacy. The Foundation is
    guided by the underlying philosophy that the basic principle of social development is to create an
    enabling environment for society to develop their full potential, lead productive lives, exercise their
    choices and participate in decision-making processes. With focus on the marginalized section of the
    society, without any discriminatory or biased approach, the Foundation has adopted the
    methodology of community based work. Working with the community, it has successfully been able
    to initiate a discussion about the need and benefit of education and create an engagement with the
    youth for livelihood opportunities and related skill-based training. Simultaneously, the Foundation is
    also actively engaged in Advocacy and campaigning for the holistic education of all members of
    society.
