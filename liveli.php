        Livelihood is effective in improving the living conditions and economic status of the
        marginalized communities. It is a means of making a living and helps them evolve. It
        empowers them economically thus leading to positive change in their social indicators by
        widening their access to healthcare services, educational services and other resources
        necessary for their overall social development and progress. The focus should be on
        capacity building, fostering networks, supporting SHGs and other small or medium
        enterprises, creating sustainable models for skill development and livelihood prospects.<br>
        Our focus is towards identifying such areas and communities and providing them with
        livelihood skills and generating sustainable livelihoods, which are in accordance to their
        requirements and capabilities thus helping them in their economic upliftment and social well-
        being.
